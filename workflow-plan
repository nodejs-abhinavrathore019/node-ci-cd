setup -> build -> lint -> test -> tag_release

- using single job
- using code splitting using actions
- using caching for setup
- using docker container
- re-useable workflows
    - WF1 => setup -> build -> lint -> test
    - WF2 => tag_release
- Dispatched workflows for version_bump => create a tag.
- can we share node setup using artifacts
